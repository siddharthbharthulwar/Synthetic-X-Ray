# Synthetic X-Ray STS Research 2020 - 2021

Reconstructing CT volumes in 3D using convolutional encoder-decoder representation frameworks and generative adversarial networks. Preliminary (bad) results are stored in inference.ipynb and should be accessed via Google Colaboratory or JupyterLab. 

CT -> X-ray from:

A. Moturu and A. Chang, “Creation of synthetic x-rays to train a neural network to detect lung cancer.” http://www.cs.toronto.edu/pub/reports/na/Project_Report_Moturu_Chang_1.pdf, 2018.

X-ray -> CT from GAN (not made yet)
